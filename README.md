# CashWash
2018 will remain in history as the year in which the puzzle of populist souverainism started coming together in a big network of illicit cash flows. Having experience in crime prevention and bank transactions, at the end of December 2018 I got hold of my first money laundering data set. The result is an open source project I called CashWash and this is its code repository.

This project is using data from the [Azerbaijani Laundromat](https://www.occrp.org/en/azerbaijanilaundromat/) investigation by [OCCRP](https://occrp.org) and [Berlingske](https://www.berlingske.dk), available under the [CreativeCommons Attribution 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.

The following data sources are currently considered for integration (permission for integration pending or integration in progress):

* [OpenCorporates](https://opencorporates.com) under their [CreativeCommons Atrribution-ShareAlike 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) licence.
* [Bank.codes](https://bank.codes).

No data from any of these data sources is published here. The code allows you to provide your own API keys and extract any data yourself.
